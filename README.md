## Description
This project was a cummination of all the materials learned during Programming 3 which focused heavily on the SOLID principles of programming. We had to make a sport centered web-app while following SOLID design. The project had the following deliverables: Sports should have names, descriptions, and a collections of teams. Teams should have names, descriptions, and collections of players. Players should have names, descriptions and stats. All of these elements or collections should be able to be modified by the user and their changes should be saved.
